    cd path/to/client-frontend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### 2. Client Back-end

1. Navigate to the Client Back-end directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/client-backend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### 3. SuperAdmin Front-end

1. Navigate to the SuperAdmin Front-end directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/superadmin-frontend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### 4. SuperAdmin Back-end

1. Navigate to the SuperAdmin Back-end directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/superadmin-backend
    ```

## Project Structure

- **Client Front-end**: React application for client-side user interfaces.
- **Client Back-end**: Node.js and Express application for client-side APIs, with JWT for security.
- **SuperAdmin Front-end**: React application for super admin user interfaces.
- **SuperAdmin Back-end**: Node.js and Express application for super admin APIs, with JWT for security.

## Running the Project

You need to run all four projects in parallel to ensure the application works correctly. Open four separate terminal windows or tabs and execute the `npm start` command in each of the project directories as outlined above.

## Security

The backend applications use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for security to ensure secure authentication and authorization. Make sure you keep your JWT secrets and other sensitive information secure and do not expose them in your code.

## Conclusion

By following the steps above, you should be able to set up and run the project locally. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation or contact for assistance.
